### Floc Collisions App

The `Collisions` file is a Jupyter notebook that calculates the collision frequency functions for colliding particles using the *short-range* model.

This notebook does the following:
* Creates particles in the size range of 0.1 - 100um
* Calculates collision frequency functions using the long-range and short-range models
* Find the dominant CFF mechanisms
* Plots all the figures
